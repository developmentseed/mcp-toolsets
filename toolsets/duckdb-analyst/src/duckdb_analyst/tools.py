"""LangChain tools for duckdb-analyst: sandbox-free SQL analysis over public
parquet datasets via a security-hardened, read-only DuckDB connection.

Three tools, deliberately minimal: explore what's available (`list_sources`),
run a SELECT (`query`), or run one and drop the rows straight into a
caller-supplied Vega-Lite spec (`chart`). No bespoke per-dataset tool — a new
dataset is a `CREATE VIEW` in `connection.py`, not a fourth tool, and it
becomes reachable through `query`/`chart` and discoverable via `list_sources`
(see `connection.SOURCES`).

The actual security model (why arbitrary SQL is safe to run here) lives in
`connection.py`'s module docstring — read that before changing anything here.
This module's own job is narrower: reject obviously-wrong SQL early
(`security.validate_select_only`), enforce the row cap server-side, bound
execution time, and turn DuckDB's own errors into `ToolError`s instead of
raising.
