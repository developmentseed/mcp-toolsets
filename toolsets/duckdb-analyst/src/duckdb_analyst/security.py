"""Statement-shape validation for caller-supplied SQL.

This is defense-in-depth, not the primary control — read
``connection.py``'s module docstring first for the actual security model.
In particular: none of this stops a file-reading table function
(``read_text``, ``read_csv``, ``glob``, ...) called from inside an otherwise
valid ``SELECT``. That class of risk is handled by ``connection.py`` locking
down DuckDB's filesystem access and by the deployment shipping no local
secrets — not by anything in this module.
